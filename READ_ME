I decresed the gravity of the the charictor so that he can jump higher in one jump. I also made it so that the trees are trasparent so you wont get stuck on it.
I changed the size of all the platforms so that there is more varity to the game. I put little people to add more decore to the background. Something difficult 
I found was that when I wanted to make the gravity lower, it did not work, so I a few times and then I asked Neil to help he and he showed me how to do it.
